# Supply_chain: 
#### To address the problem of supply chain dependency blindspots, a detailed plan can be structured around the three main goals: building transparent systems, predicting disruptions, and enabling autonomous rerouting. The following is an outline of the steps to achieve these goals, incorporating the possible solutions identified in the problem statement. 

### 1) High-level architecture
 - Monorepo (Turborepo) with three apps + one shared package:
 - apps/web — Next.js 14 (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind, shadcn/ui, next-auth, Mapbox GL JS, React Query, tRPC client.
 - apps/api — NestJS (TypeScript) with Prisma (PostgreSQL), tRPC HTTP bridge, Zod DTOs, BullMQ (Redis) for jobs, Socket.IO for realtime, Passport for auth (JWT).
 - apps/ai — FastAPI (Python) for forecasting/risk scoring; scikit-learn/Prophet-ready. Communicates via REST + Redis queue.- 
 - packages/shared — Shared types (zod + TypeScript), API contracts, event schemas, RBAC enums.
 - Infra: Docker Compose (PostgreSQL, Redis), optional LocalStack (S3-compatible) for file storage, Mailhog for email preview.
 - Blockchain seam: Start with a mock blockchain adapter (file+DB backed) that preserves an immutable hash chain. Later swap to Hyperledger/EVM via the adapter interface.
 - Realtime: Socket.IO rooms by org + role for dashboards, alerts, and job progress.
